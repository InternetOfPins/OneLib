Pin manipulation meta-framework
OnePin meta-framework can overlay existing frameworks with zero cost

Along with the pin manipulation functions there are also a couple of composable
utilities like debouncing or action coupling

A top layer with virtual functions is provided for library abstracion over Pins

A couple of small examples of libraries included, OneButton, OneEncoder, ClickButton

This is the base for IOP - The Internet Of Pins
on the sequence of VirtualPins proposals done to Arduino framework
