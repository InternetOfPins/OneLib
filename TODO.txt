OnePin map[]={...};
- add error pin, a pin that can not be used and errors at compile time
- start OnePin map with error pins
- allocate pins at compile time => virtual class of OnePin?
- do now allow reallocation (at compile time)
- however pin operations will NOT use the map, all info is stored on the pin
- aggregate all begins? only from maps.

- join Func and MFunc into a single Action
- implement soft pins with relative and absolute times

- unify schedule? this is too complicated
